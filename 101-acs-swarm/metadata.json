  "description": "Deploy an Azure Container Service instance for the hosting and management of Docker Containers. Azure Container Service optimizes the configuration of popular open source tools and technologies specifically for Azure. You get an open solution that offers portability for both your containers and your application configuration. You select the size, the number of hosts, and choice of orchestrator tools, and Container Service handles everything else.

Azure Container Service offers you a choice of tools for container orchestration and scale operations. Use Docker Swarm and Compose for a pure Docker experience. Or, use the popular Apache Mesos and selected frameworks for an alternative approach. You choose the solution that suits your needs. 

We work closely with the open source community and, by exposing the standard API endpoints for our orchestration engine, we ensure that the most popular open source tools are not only compatible with Azure Container Service, but in most cases will work out of the box. This includes current tools such as visualizers, monitoring, continuous integration, and command line tools, as well as future tools and features as they become available. 

Sicne individual container is portable doesn’t mean your application will be we’ve been careful to only use open source components in the orchestration layer of our service. This ensures your application not only uses the popular features of these tools, but will be able to seamlessly migrate workloads to and from Azure at will.",
