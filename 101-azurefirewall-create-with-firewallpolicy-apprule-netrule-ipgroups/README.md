This template deploys an Azure Firewall with Firewall Policy (including multiple application and network rules) referencing IP Groups in application and network rules.

IP Groups is a top-level resource that allows you to group and manage IP addresses in Firewall Policy rules. You can give your IP Group a name and create one by entering IP addresses or uploading a file. It eases your management experience and reduce time spent managing IP addresses by using them in a single firewall policy or across multiple firewall policies.

An IP Group can support individual or multiple IP addresses, ranges, or subnets.
