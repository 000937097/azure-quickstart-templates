This is a test template to create a Docker Swarm cluster on Azure. It uses Docker hub as a discovery service and requires token(cluster id) as a parameter. Users need to create a token id using command 'docker run swarm create' before the template deployment. It can be used for the test purposes but not recommanded for the production.
