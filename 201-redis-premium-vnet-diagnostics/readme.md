# Create a Premium Redis Cache with Virtual Network

Create and configure Premium Redis Cache with Virtual Network support by using a template. Azure Virtual Network (VNET) deployment provides enhanced security and isolation for your Azure Redis Cache, as well as subnets, access control policies, and other features to further restrict access to Azure Redis Cache.

This template does not include clustering, but both clustering and Virtual Network support is available in the template [Create Premium Redis Cache with Virtual Network and clustering](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/templates/201-redis-premium-vnet-cluster-diagnostics/).

For information about using this template, see [How to configure Virtual Network Support for a Premium Azure Redis Cache](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cache-how-to-premium-vnet/).
