<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2F251744647%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2Frhel-desktop-gnome-rdp%2Fazuredeploy.json" target="_blank"><img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/></a>

This template uses the Azure Linux CustomScript extension to deploy Gnome Desktop on the VM. It creates an RHEL VM, does a silent install of gnome desktop and xrdp, allows you to connect it with Remote Desktop from a Windows machine.



Please kindly note that if you use windows remote desktop client to connect to xrdp and receive an error message similar to "â€¦only supporting 8,15,16,24 bpp rdp connections." One possibility is that your remote desktop client is set to use Highest Quality (32) Colors.  You have to lower this setting. Follow this: "Remote Desktop Connection" -- "Show options" -- "Display" -- "Colors" -- choose the color.
